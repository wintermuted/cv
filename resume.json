        "summary": "I am Software Engineer living and working in beautiful Portland, Oregon with my wife Rachel & our dog Sophie, where we live out the dream of the 90's.  I currently work at Jama Software, where along with an amazing team of cross-functional engineers, I develop software tools for managing product development.  In my free time, I geek out on functional programming, IoT, transit mapping services, and mobile/wearable devices.  When I manage to escape the warm glow of a computer terminal, I enjoy camping, hiking, cooking, making cocktails, and a long list of stereotypically nerdy activities.",
